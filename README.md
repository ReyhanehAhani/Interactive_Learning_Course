# Interactive Learning Projects


This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of an interactive learning course. The projects are designed to demonstrate various concepts and techniques in interactive learning environments, single agent scenarios, and social learning strategies.

## Projects Overview

- **ABCO.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that serves as an introductory overview or combines elements from the different projects. It may contain code, visualizations, and explanations that tie together the concepts explored in the course.
- **Environment**: Contains the code and resources necessary to set up the interactive learning environments used in the projects.
- **Single Agent**: This directory holds the projects focused on single agent scenarios. These projects explore the behaviors, strategies, and learning mechanisms that an individual agent employs in isolation.
- **Social Learning**: Includes projects that investigate social learning strategies. Here, the emphasis is on how agents learn from each other, share knowledge, and evolve their strategies in a communal or competitive setting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running these projects, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Relevant Python libraries as specified in the project requirements (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, pandas)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP and extract it in your preferred location.
2. Install the required Python libraries. You can usually install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Note: A `requirements.txt` file should be created and placed in the root directory if specific libraries are needed._

### Running the Projects

To run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook ABCO.ipynb
```
