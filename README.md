# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`DQN.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks to enable agents to learn how to act optimally in controlled environments. The DQN algorithm has been pivotal in the field of reinforcement learning, particularly in solving complex problems that require making a sequence of decisions.

## Overview

The `DQN.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive guide to implementing the DQN algorithm from scratch. It is designed to help users understand the core concepts behind DQN, including experience replay, fixed Q-targets, and the use of neural networks as function approximators. This implementation focuses on a specific environment (likely one from OpenAI Gym, though the notebook doesn't specify), showcasing how DQN can be applied to learn optimal policies.

## Features

- **Experience Replay**: Utilizes a replay buffer to store and sample experience tuples, improving learning stability and efficiency.
- **Fixed Q-Targets**: Implements fixed Q-targets to decouple target value calculation from the network's parameter updates, mitigating harmful correlations.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Details the neural network used as a function approximator for the Q-function, including layer configurations and activation functions.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Offers a detailed walkthrough of the training loop, including exploration strategies, loss calculation, and model evaluation.

# Reward Function Analysis in Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `Reyhaneh.Ahani_HW2_Codes.ipynb`, which is dedicated to the analysis of expected rewards for actions according to a given reward function. This analysis is crucial in the field of reinforcement learning, where understanding the reward structure is essential for designing agents that can learn optimal behaviors.

## Overview

The notebook provides a detailed examination of how different actions within a specific environment yield different expected rewards. Through this analysis, students, researchers, and practitioners can gain insights into the dynamics of reward functions and their impact on agent behavior. The notebook likely uses a combination of theoretical explanations and practical examples to illustrate these concepts.

## Key Concepts

### Expected Rewards
This section introduces the concept of expected rewards in the context of reinforcement learning, detailing the mathematical framework used to calculate them for various actions within a specific environment. Expected rewards are crucial for understanding the potential outcomes of actions and guide the learning process of an agent. The notebook may include formulas, code examples, and theoretical explanations to demonstrate how to compute these values effectively.

### Reward Function
The reward function is a central component of any reinforcement learning system, determining the immediate payoff received after executing an action in a particular state. This part of the notebook explores how reward functions are designed and their impact on agent behavior. It might cover different types of reward functions, from simple to complex, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in various scenarios.

### Analysis and Visualization
Effective analysis and visualization of the relationships between actions and their expected rewards are critical for interpreting the behavior of learning agents. This section likely covers the use of Python libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to create plots, charts, and heatmaps that visually represent these relationships. Visualizations can help identify patterns, outliers, and trends in the data, providing insights that are not immediately obvious from raw numbers.

### Decision Making
Finally, the notebook discusses how the analysis of reward functions influences the decision-making processes of reinforcement learning agents. It might include discussions on policy development, where the goal is to choose actions that maximize the cumulative expected reward over time. This section could also explore various decision-making strategies, such as greedy approaches, exploration vs. exploitation trade-offs, and the use of decision-making under uncertainty principles.


Based on the initial analysis of the `Reyhaneh_Ahani_IL_HW3_Codes.ipynb` notebook, which primarily introduces and discusses various libraries, we'll craft a README that highlights the notebook's focus on interactive learning (IL) through the lens of library utilization. This README will aim to provide comprehensive details about the notebook's purpose, contents, and usage.
